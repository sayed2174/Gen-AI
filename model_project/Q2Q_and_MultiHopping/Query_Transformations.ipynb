            "\n",
            "3. Installing UAD and enabling ADB: The user installs UAD on their computer and sets up ADB on their device. This can be done by running the command `adb devices` in the terminal or command prompt on the computer to verify the connection.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Selecting the packages or apps to be removed: UAD provides a list of pre-installed apps, system services, and bloatware that can be removed. The user can select the packages or apps they want to remove.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Debloating the device: Once the selection is made, UAD generates a script that removes the selected packages or apps from the device. The user then runs this script using ADB by executing the command `adb sideload <path_to_script>` in the terminal or command prompt.\n",
            "\n",

            "It's important to note that debloating non-system apps can help improve the performance, battery life, and privacy of the Android device by reducing the number of running processes and services. However, debloating system apps or critical system services can potentially cause issues with the device's functionality. Therefore, it's recommended to be cautious when debloating and to thoroughly research each package or app before removing it.\n",

            "To debloat an Android device using Universal Android Debloater, users can follow these steps:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Install Android SDK Platform-Tools (ADB) on your computer if you haven't already.\n",
            "2. Download and install Universal Android Debloater from its official GitHub repository.\n",
            "3. Connect your Android device to your computer.\n",
            "4. Open Universal Android Debloater and select your device from the list of devices detected.\n",
            "5. Choose the packages (applications or system files) you want to remove from the list of available packages.\n",
            "6. Click on the \"Install\" button to start the debloating process.\n",
