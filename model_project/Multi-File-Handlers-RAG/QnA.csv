0,give me sum of two numbers code ?,"To find the sum of two numbers in the provided context, you can create a new variable for one of the numbers and then modify the existing variable with the sum of the two numbers. Here's an example:

```python
a = 5
b = 10
c = a + b
a = c - b
print(a, c)
```

This code first assigns values 5 and 10 to variables `a` and `b`, respectively. It then calculates the sum of the two numbers (which is stored in the variable `c`). After that, it assigns the original value of `a` (5) to `b` and the calculated sum (15) to `a`. The final output will be `15 5`, indicating that the sum of `a` and `b` is `15`, and `a` now holds that value."
