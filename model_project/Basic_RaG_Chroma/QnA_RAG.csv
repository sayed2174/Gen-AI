0,What is prompt engineering and why is it important for LLMs?,"Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting and refining inputs for large language models. It involves structuring prompts in such a way that guides the model's behavior, with a focus on achieving desired, high-quality model outputs. This skill is essential for maximizing the utility of Language Learning Models (LLMs) as it enables the control and direction of the model's responses to generate more useful and accurate outputs."
1,What is the difference between instruction prompting and completion prompting?,"In the provided context, instruction prompting refers to providing guidance or direction to the language model (LLM) on what task it should perform, shaping its behavior and utility. On the other hand, completion prompting would likely refer to a prompt that asks the LLM to complete a specific task or answer a question based on the instructions given earlier. In other words, instruction prompting sets the task, while completion prompting asks the model to perform the task based on the instructions provided."
2,"What are zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompts?","Zero-shot prompts refer to a type of instruction or question that a model is expected to answer based solely on the knowledge it has been trained on. It doesn't require additional examples or fine-tuning for a specific task.

One-shot prompts, on the other hand, provide a single example, in addition to the question, to help the model understand the task better. This is a step towards fine-tuning the model for a specific task, but it still relies on the general knowledge the model has already learned.

Few-shot prompts are similar to one-shot prompts, but they provide multiple examples instead of just one, with the aim of giving the model a more comprehensive understanding of the task at hand. This can help improve the model's performance on tasks it has not been explicitly trained on."
3,How does prompt structure affect model output quality?,"Based on the provided context, the prompt structure significantly affects the quality of the model output in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the context does not provide specific details on how this happens. It's possible that a well-structured prompt could lead to more coherent, relevant, and accurate responses from the model, while a poorly structured prompt could result in less reliable or less useful responses. The presentation likely delves into these and other aspects of prompt evaluation in more detail."
4,What is role prompting and how does it work?,"Role prompting is a technique used in AI models like me, where the model is instructed to adopt a specific identity and behavioral style. This method is particularly useful for generating responses with an expert tone, targeting a specific audience, or ensuring domain-specific accuracy. It works by providing the model with a clear set of guidelines about the persona or role it should assume, thereby shaping the responses it generates to match that persona or role."
5,What is chain-of-thought prompting?,"Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) is a method that encourages language models to think through a problem step-by-step, mirroring effective human problem-solving. This approach aims to produce more reliable outcomes, accurate, consistent, and explainable answers from language models."
6,Why can chain-of-thought improve reasoning tasks?,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve reasoning tasks because it mirrors effective human problem-solving, leading to more reliable outcomes. Additionally, CoT prompts encourage ""slow thinking,"" resulting in more accurate, consistent, and explainable answers from Language Models (LLMs)."
7,What is self-consistency prompting?,"Self-consistency in the given context is prompting the process of generating multiple reasoning trajectories, which helps to reduce hallucinations and leads to a more stable and accurate final answer. This technique enhances the robustness of the reasoning process, particularly for challenging questions."
8,What are prompt templates?,"Prompt templates, in the context provided, are structures or formats that are used to craft and refine inputs for large language models (LLMs). They serve as a way to guide the model's behavior and help achieve desired, high-quality outputs, which are essential for maximizing the utility of LLMs."
9,What is prompt leakage?,"Prompt leakage, in the context of Prompt Engineering, refers to a situation where the original prompt or some part of it unintentionally remains in the output generated by the language model, influencing its response in a way that was not intended by the user. This can sometimes lead to undesirable results or biases in the model's output."
10,How do system prompts differ from user prompts?,"System prompts are typically preset or predefined instructions that are provided by the system to initiate an interaction with the large language model (LLM). On the other hand, user prompts are the inputs generated by human users to engage with the LLM and seek desired responses. In essence, while system prompts are designed to guide the model's behavior during the initial interaction, user prompts aim to elicit specific and high-quality outputs from the model."
11,What is prompt injection?,"Prompt injection is a technique within Prompt Engineering, where specific inputs or instructions are given to a large language model (LLM) to guide its behavior and achieve desired, high-quality outputs. It involves creating well-structured prompts to influence the responses generated by the model."
12,How can prompt injection be mitigated?,"Without additional context specific to the Zero-Shot Prompting, it's challenging to give a precise answer. However, in general terms, to mitigate prompt injection issues, one could consider the following strategies:

1. Vetting and validating input prompts to ensure they meet certain standards or follow predefined guidelines.
2. Implementing robust models that are resilient to malicious or misleading prompts and can maintain their performance even in the presence of such inputs.
3. Using diverse training data to improve the model's ability to deal with a wide range of prompts.
4. Developing techniques to detect and flag unusual or suspicious prompts for manual review or further analysis.
5. Continuously monitoring and updating the model based on feedback and new findings related to prompt injection vulnerabilities."
13,What is instruction hierarchy in prompts?,"The context provided does not explicitly mention an ""instruction hierarchy in prompts."" However, it does imply that prompts for large language models (LLMs) are structured in a way that guides the model's behavior and focuses on achieving high-quality outputs. This could potentially be interpreted as a hierarchy, where more specific or detailed instructions might lead to more refined outputs. But the context does not provide enough information to definitively answer the question about an instruction hierarchy."
14,What are delimiters used for in prompts?,"Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of delimiters in the prompts. However, delimiters are typically used to separate different parts of a prompt to help the model understand the structure and relationships between different components. This could potentially help reduce ""hallucinations"" and improve factual correctness, as well as ensure predictable structure and formatting every time, as mentioned in the context. But the context does not specify delimiters are used in the way you asked."
15,What is context window and why does it matter?,"The context window refers to a specific range of text or data that a machine learning model considers when making predictions. It helps the model understand the surrounding context of a given input, thus improving its accuracy. If the context window is exceeded, the model might not be able to consider enough context, which could potentially lead to less accurate predictions. However, the exact implications depend on the specific model and the task it's designed to perform."
16,What happens when prompts exceed context length?,"If prompts exceed the context window, the model may not be able to fully understand the history of the conversation and generate a response that is relevant to the entire context. It may respond based on the most recent prompts or a combination of the context and the recent prompts. This can lead to responses that do not fully address the question or are unrelated to the original topic of the conversation."
17,How do temperature and top-p affect prompt outputs?,"Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss the impact of temperature and top-p on prompt outputs directly. However, it does emphasize that well-designed prompts are crucial for effective interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to enhanced accuracy, consistent outputs, and automation-readiness. It's important to note that temperature and top-p are hyperparameters that influence the randomness and diversity of the model's outputs, but not the design of the prompts themselves."
18,What are common prompt engineering anti-patterns?,"Common prompt engineering anti-patterns could include:

1. Vague or ambiguous prompts: These may lead to unclear or unsatisfactory outputs from the language model.
2. Overly complex or lengthy prompts: These can confuse the model and result in convoluted or incoherent responses.
3. Asking the model to make assumptions without providing context: This can lead to incorrect or off-topic responses.
4. Asking the model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously: It's generally more effective to break tasks down into simpler steps.
5. Asking the model to generate creative content without providing a clear direction: This can result in responses that are not aligned with the intended purpose.
6. Ignoring the need to pre-train the model on specific domains or topics: This can lead to poor performance when the model is asked to generate outputs related to those areas.
7. Not testing and iterating on prompts: This can prevent you from finding the most effective way to guide the model's behavior.
8. Relying too heavily on the model without human oversight: This can result in errors or biases in the model's outputs.
9. Neglecting ethical considerations: It's important to consider the potential consequences of the model's outputs and ensure they are aligned with ethical guidelines.
10. Not providing appropriate feedback: This can prevent the model from learning and improving over time."
19,How do you evaluate prompt effectiveness?,"To evaluate prompt effectiveness, you can follow these steps:

1. Clarity: The prompt should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. If the model is struggling to understand the task, it may be due to ambiguities or complexities in the prompt.

2. Relevance: The prompt should be directly related to the task you want the model to perform. If the prompt veers off-topic, the model may provide irrelevant or unhelpful responses.

3. Specificity: The prompt should be specific enough to guide the model towards the correct answer. Broad or vague prompts may lead to unhelpful or incorrect responses.

4. Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop where you provide the model with examples of good and bad responses, and it learns to improve its responses over time.

5. Context Window Size: Adjust the context window size to ensure the model has access to the most relevant information for its response. A too small window may limit the model's understanding, while a too large window may confuse it with unnecessary information.

6. Testing: Test the prompts on multiple examples to ensure they work consistently and provide the desired results.

7. Iterative Improvement: Continuously refine and improve your prompts based on the model's performance and feedback. This is an ongoing process and may require many iterations to achieve the best results.

During Day 2, you can explore advanced prompting strategies to further improve your prompts, such as chaining prompts, using metaphors, and incorporating multiple choice questions."
20,What are embeddings in LLM systems?,"Embeddings, in the context of LLM (Language Model) systems, are a way to represent words or concepts as numerical vectors in a multi-dimensional space. These vectors are designed to capture the semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as the one demonstrated in the question where ""King"" – ""Man"" + ""Woman"" ≈ ""Queen."" This allows LLMs to understand nuanced relationships between words and concepts, and to make more accurate predictions about how words will be used in a given context."
21,How are embeddings different from tokens?,"Embeddings are different from tokens in that tokens are the raw, discrete units of text (such as individual words, characters, or subwords) while embeddings are high-dimensional dense vector representations of these tokens. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships of the input, transforming the discrete tokens into a continuous space where similar meanings are mapped to vectors that are numerically ""closer"" to each other, and dissimilar meanings are mapped to vectors that are ""far apart."""
22,What does cosine similarity measure?,"Cosine similarity measures the relatedness between two vectors by focusing on the orientation of the vectors, indicating how similar their directions are, rather than their magnitude."
23,What is the difference between cosine similarity and Euclidean distance?,"Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance are different methods used to compare two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. Euclidean distance calculates the straight-line distance between two points, focusing on the magnitude of the vectors. In contrast, cosine similarity focuses on the orientation of vectors, indicating how similar their directions are, regardless of their magnitude. This makes cosine similarity more suitable for high-dimensional spaces where Euclidean distance can perform poorly."
24,Why are embeddings high-dimensional?,"Embeddings are high-dimensional because they are designed to capture the complex semantic meaning and contextual relationships of the input. The high-dimensional space allows for a more nuanced representation of the data, enabling the model to differentiate between subtle meanings and relationships."
25,What does semantic similarity mean?,"In the given context, semantic similarity refers to the closeness or likeness between words in terms of their meanings. In high-dimensional spaces, words with similar meanings may be far apart in Euclidean distance (straight-line distance) but still have a small angle between them. Cosine similarity, as mentioned, is a measure that effectively captures this semantic closeness, focusing on the direction rather than the distance between the words."
26,How are embeddings generated?,"Embeddings are generated by learning algorithms that map raw text data, such as words or documents, onto high-dimensional dense vector spaces. The process involves training a model on a large corpus of text data to learn the semantic relationships and context between words. The result is a set of numerical representations, or embeddings, that capture the meaning and context of the input data."
27,Why are embeddings model-specific?,"Embeddings are model-specific because they are learned and optimized within the context of a particular language model. The relationships between words and concepts that the embeddings capture are based on the data and training of that specific model. Different language models may learn slightly different embeddings due to differences in their training data, architecture, or objectives."
28,What happens if you mix embeddings from different models?,"Mixing embeddings from different models can lead to a loss of consistency and coherence, as each model may have learned different representations for the same concepts. However, techniques like transfer learning and multi-model fusion can be used to combine embeddings from different models in a way that preserves some of the original meaning and improves the overall performance of the model."
29,What is embedding normalization?,"Embedding normalization, in the context of the provided information, is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that normalization might refer to a process that ensures the embeddings (the high-dimensional dense vector representations) have a consistent scale, allowing for better comparisons between vectors and improving the model's ability to capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships of the input. This could involve techniques like normalizing the L2 norm, or mean and standard deviation of the embeddings' values. Without additional context, it's hard to be certain about the exact definition of embedding normalization in this context."
30,Why do we normalize vectors?,"In the provided context, the vectors are not normalized. Normalization is not explicitly mentioned. However, normalization is a common process in vector space modeling, particularly in machine learning and natural language processing, to ensure that the magnitude of the vectors does not affect the similarity scores. This is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional spaces, as different scales can distort the similarity between vectors. Normalizing the vectors so that they all have the same length (usually length 1) allows for a fair comparison of their directions, which is essential for determining semantic similarity. If normalization was used in the given context, it would have been to compare the directions of the vectors (their semantic similarity) regardless of their magnitudes."
31,What is vector dimensionality?,"Vector dimensionality refers to the length or number of components in a vector representation of a sentence or word. It determines the amount of context and nuance the embedding can capture, with higher dimensions (e.g., 768 or 1536) allowing for richer, more detailed representations."
32,How does chunk size affect embeddings?,"The context does not provide explicit information about how the chunk size affects embeddings. However, it suggests that breaking down long documents into smaller chunks can help manage computational resources and potentially retain contextual nuances, which might indirectly influence the quality of the embeddings. But the specific impact of the chunk size on embeddings is not detailed in the provided context."
33,What is embedding drift?,"Embedding drift refers to a situation where the vectors representing concepts in a word embedding model gradually shift over time, causing a decrease in the model's ability to accurately capture semantic relationships between those concepts. This drift can occur due to changes in the data distribution, language usage, or other factors."
34,How do embeddings help semantic search?,"Embeddings help semantic search by allowing the representation of words, phrases, or concepts in a high-dimensional vector space where the semantic similarity between the items is preserved. This way, semantic search algorithms can compare the meaning of queries with those of documents, making it possible to return more relevant results, even if the exact keywords are not used in the documents."
35,What is embedding recall vs precision?,"In the provided context, there's no mention of embedding recall vs precision. Embeddings themselves are high-dimensional vector representations of text, words, or documents that capture their semantic meanings. Recall and precision are concepts related to evaluation metrics in machine learning and information retrieval, but they are not directly related to embeddings in the given context."
36,Why are embeddings better than keyword search?,"Embeddings are better than keyword search because they capture semantic meaning, which allows for a better understanding of the context and nuances in the data. This results in improved retrieval accuracy, making them more effective for semantic search or RAG systems. Additionally, embeddings can often be faster than keyword search, which is essential for real-time applications."
37,How do embeddings handle synonyms?,"Embeddings handle synonyms by mapping similar words (like synonyms) to vectors that are numerically ""closer"" to each other in the semantic space. This means that words with similar meanings will have similar embeddings, while words with vastly different meanings will have embeddings that are ""far apart""."
38,What are multilingual embeddings?,"Multilingual embeddings are high-dimensional dense vector representations of text, words, or even entire documents in multiple languages. They capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships of the input in different languages, allowing for comparisons and analysis across languages. In the semantic space, texts with similar meanings in different languages are mapped to vectors that are numerically ""closer"" to each other, while texts with vastly different meanings in different languages will have vectors that are ""far apart."""
39,What are the limitations of embeddings?,"The text provided does not specify any limitations of embeddings. However, in general, some limitations of embeddings can be:

1. High dimensionality: Embeddings are high-dimensional vectors, which can lead to the curse of dimensionality, making it difficult to find patterns and causing overfitting.

2. Lack of context: While embeddings capture semantic meaning and contextual relationships, they may not always capture specific details or nuances in the text, especially for complex or ambiguous words.

3. Bias: Embeddings can reflect biases present in the training data, leading to inaccurate or unfair representations of certain words or topics.

4. Difficulty in interpretation: The high-dimensional nature of embeddings makes it challenging for humans to interpret and understand the relationships between words in the vector space.

5. Limited coverage: Pre-trained embeddings may not cover all possible words or specific domains, which can lead to poor performance when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words or domain-specific language."
40,What is chunking in RAG systems?,Chunking in RAG systems refers to the process of breaking down documents into optimally sized segments for efficient retrieval.
41,Why is chunking necessary?,"Chunking is necessary for Large Language Models (LLMs) because they cannot process entire documents at once. Chunking helps break down the content into manageable, smaller pieces, or ""meaningful chunks,"" which retain coherence and context. This ensures effective information retrieval, which is crucial for a superior RAG system."
42,What is fixed-size chunking?,"Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of ""fixed-size chunking."" However, the text does suggest that a chunk should not be merely cut at fixed intervals as it often disrupts meaning and reduces utility. Therefore, it can be inferred that fixed-size chunking is a method of splitting text where each chunk has a predetermined, constant size, which may not be optimal for maintaining coherent thoughts or concepts."
43,What is semantic chunking?,"Semantic chunking is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the given context, semantic chunking could be understood as the process of organizing related ideas or sentences coherently to facilitate effective understanding and retrieval. In contrast, a ""bad"" chunk refers to an incomplete, fragmented, or unrelated piece of information that can hinder this process."
44,What is sliding window chunking?,"Sliding window chunking, in the context of the provided information, refers to a method where the model processes a segment of text, moves a certain number of positions (or steps) forward, and then processes the next segment, continuing this process until it has processed the entire input. This method is used to handle long sequences by breaking them down into smaller, manageable chunks, while also allowing the model to maintain some context from previous chunks (limited by the window size). When the model moves forward by one step (or chunk), it effectively ""forgets"" some of the information from the earlier chunks that falls outside of the current window."
45,What is overlap (lap size) in chunking?,"Based on the provided context, the text does not contain any information about overlap (lap size) in chunking. The context emphasizes that a chunk should encapsulate a single, coherent thought or concept and not merely be a random split, but it does not mention overlap or any specific guidelines for the size or structure of the chunks."
46,Why is overlap important?,"Overlap is important because it effectively bridges potential gaps, ensuring that key information at chunk boundaries remains connected and retrievable. This helps balance detail, context preservation, and processing efficiency, making it ideal for robust Q&A interactions."
47,What happens if overlap is zero?,"With zero overlap, key information at chunk boundaries would not be effectively bridged, potentially leading to disconnected or incomplete information. This could negatively impact the retrieval of important details and the overall efficiency of Q&A interactions."
48,What are optimal chunk sizes for text documents?,"The context does not specify optimal chunk sizes for text documents. It only mentions that long documents can be broken down into smaller segments or ""chunks,"" which can be paragraphs, sentences, or fixed-size blocks of text."
49,What are optimal chunk sizes for code?,"The context provided does not discuss optimal chunk sizes for code. The discussion is about Fixed Size Chunking in the context of text processing, not coding."
50,How does chunking affect retrieval accuracy?,"Chunking affects retrieval accuracy positively by enabling effective information retrieval, which is the cornerstone of a superior RAG system. This is because documents are split into meaningful chunks, ensuring that each piece retains coherence and context, making it easier for the Large Language Model to accurately process and retrieve relevant information."
51,What is token-aware chunking?,"Token-aware chunking, in the context provided, refers to a methodology that ensures key information at chunk boundaries remains connected and retrievable, by maintaining a 50-token overlap between adjacent chunks. This approach balances detail, context preservation, and processing efficiency, making it suitable for robust Q&A interactions."
52,How do headings affect chunking?,"Headings do not directly affect chunking in the context provided, as chunking refers to the division of text into manageable pieces for analysis, and headings are typically used for organizing and summarizing the content within a document. However, headings can indirectly impact the quality of the chunks by providing clear structure and context, which can help prevent issues like mid-sentence cuts, unrelated lines, and ambiguous context. A well-structured document with clear headings can make it easier for the Language Model (LLM) to understand and answer queries accurately."
53,What is hierarchical chunking?,"In the given context, hierarchical chunking isn't explicitly mentioned. However, based on the other chunking strategies provided, I can infer that hierarchical chunking might refer to the ""Recursive Text Splitter"" strategy. This is because it suggests a structure that splits text in a hierarchical manner, respecting the document structure. But please note that this is an inference from the context provided and the original text might not have explicitly stated it as ""hierarchical chunking."""
54,What are common chunking mistakes?,"Common chunking mistakes, according to the provided context, include cutting a chunk mid-sentence (resulting in incomplete thoughts), containing fragmented ideas, having unrelated lines (leading to jumbled and incoherent information), and having an ambiguous context (which makes it hard for the LLM to interpret). These mistakes hinder effective retrieval and can make it difficult for the LLM to understand or answer queries accurately."
55,What is RAG and why is it used?,"RAG, in the given context, appears to refer to a system (presumably a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system) used in LLM (Language Model) responses. The purpose of RAG is to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of the responses by implementing several components, such as Correct & Relevant Retrieval, Structured Chunking, and Top-k Contextual Grounding. These components aim to pull accurate and pertinent information, break down documents into optimally sized segments for efficient retrieval, and select the most relevant chunks to provide sufficient context to the LLM, respectively."
56,What problems does RAG solve?,"The context provided does not explicitly state what problems RAG (RAG System) solves. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that RAG is designed to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of responses generated by an LLM (Language Learning Model). This is achieved through correct and relevant retrieval of information, structured chunking of documents, and top-k contextual grounding. Without additional context, it is not possible to specify the specific problems RAG was created to address."
57,What are the main components of a RAG pipeline?,"The main components of a RAG system, as mentioned in the provided context, are:

1. Correct & Relevant Retrieval: This component ensures that the system pulls the most accurate and pertinent information.
2. Structured Chunking: This involves breaking down documents into optimally sized segments for efficient retrieval.
3. Top-k Contextual Grounding: This is the process of selecting the most relevant 'k' chunks to provide sufficient context to the Language Model (LLM)."
58,How does retrieval differ from generation?,"Retrieval, in the context of the given text, refers to the process of integrating real, up-to-date documents into the generation process. This implies that retrieval is the process of gathering relevant information from external sources, while generation is the process of creating new information based on the gathered data and the model's internal parameters. In traditional LLMs (Language Model Luis), the internal parameters are frozen once training is complete, which means they cannot inherently access new information in real-time. However, with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), this limitation is addressed by incorporating external data into the generation process."
59,What is retrieval recall?,"Retrieval recall in the given context refers to the ability of a model with retrieval capabilities to accurately recall or find relevant information from its training data when asked a question beyond its direct knowledge, thus reducing the chances of hallucinations and providing more accurate information."
